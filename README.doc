Starting of the assignment
In the beginning of making my personal webpage I was in a dilemma about what kind of portfolio I should create. Firstly, I looked the website of Joel Stanford whose example was given in the assignment brief in NILE.  Then, I searched other people’s portfolios in the internet. I went through 4 or 5 portfolios of some people and I got some ideas to create my web page. So according to the criteria given by the University I started creating my web page using only HTML and CSS. The time to make my web page was 2 weeks after completion of course of first semester which was of 12 weeks. So I have used the properties of HTML and CSS that I have learned in the 12 weeks of first semester. And this made me easier to make my portfolio effective.
The websites that I visited were:
> http://applecrumbs.com
> http://www.helloimcody.com/
> http://www.janmense.de/
> http://www.mikereda.com/
> http://joel.sh/about

Designs
For this part I have drawn rough sketches of homepage, about me page, my cv page and contact me page.

Sketches
Homepage



I have made my homepage simple looking. I have used many divs here. I have put maroon colour in background of header and navigation part and light grey in background of section part. I have put the logo in the middle of the header. I have provided the users to navigate to other pages of my portfolio. I have divided the section into three main divs. The first and last div of section is again divided two divs. In the middle div I have added my photo and when the users click on it is transformed into small one. The footer part is at the bottom of homepage. I have put the icons and map with their links so that the users can follow me on those social websites as exactly in above sketch. The colour of the font is also maroon.

About me page


In about me page I have put the header, navigation bar and footer as same as of homepage so that the user wouldn’t feel that they are visiting different websites. Here I have divided the section into two divs. I have put my own image on image div and I have written about myself on next div.









My CV page



In this page, the header, navigation bar and footer are same as of homepage.  I have divided the section into two parts in column. And then the second div is again divided into the two parts in row.  I have written the curriculum vitae about myself personal, then my education level as well as skills and experience, at last I have written languages that I speak as you can see in above in the sketch.


Contact me page
In this page, the header, navigation bar and footer are as same as of homepage. Here, I have divided the section into two divs in the row direction. In first div I have put my contact details and my own image. On next div I have used the form property to insert form so that users can send me messages through emails. The background colour of this section is same as that of hiomepage section. The sketch for this is given below.
